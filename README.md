# DSA

This course had much to do with the different data models used in C++ and when they would be most applicable. Not being overly familiar with C++ myself, it took some
time to get used to each model and where it fits. Many of my issues stemmed from inexperience, but with some research and questions to those more knowledgeable than 
myself, I was able to accomplish each of the tasks given to me. Comments have never been my strong suit. Most of the code I write is just for me, so it's easy to look
at it and know exactly what I was doing. Since not everything in a real world setting will be only for me, I've adopted the practice of putting comments into any
code that I'm working on. That way, if someone needs to access the code and make adjustments, everything will be clearly documented for them to find what they need.
